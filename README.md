# Yellow Hat DAO
Keepers of free capital market, starting from blockchain infrastructure.

We are the Yellow Hats who play with decentralized financial primitives to experiment with crypto-native problems, in such way that tests the limit of cryptoeconomics. We wear Yellow Hats as construction workers, who make the infrastructure more robust by building the inevitables that may break the weaker ones.

The Yellow Hat DAO is a social experiment itself, emerged out of the need to pool research and capital across interesting independent initiatives. Interdisciplinary collaboration on Community GitHub can and will be recorded at the present and accounted for in the future. The Yellow Hats participate in the community on an individual bases, projects compete for resources within the organization, retain independence from each other, and maintain their own value-capture models. 

Our GitHub Organization is a common co-creation space for the Yellow Hats in ideation and prototyping experiments. New project ideas, or research directions that fit the Yellow Hat Dao mission,  may be posted as an [Issues](https://github.com/carboclan/pm/issues) . You may also post your comments or questions on existing project or research as  [Issues](https://github.com/carboclan/pm/issues) or directly create a Pull Request. Outstanding Issues will be addressed in the Yellow Hats Community Semi-weekly Governance Call.

Documentation and updates on Yellow Hats' live projects may be found in **Project Management Resources and Docs** below. We are soliciting suggestions from the Community on **Contribution Guideline** and **Community Governance**.
